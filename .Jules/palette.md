## 2024-05-23 - Toggle Switch Icon Logic
**Learning:** For toggle switches, placing an icon on the *track* (background) can be ambiguous. Users often expect the visible icon to represent the *current* state (e.g., Sun for Light Mode), even if physically the knob is on the opposite side.
**Action:** When adding icons to toggle tracks, ensure the icon visible on the exposed track represents the *current* active mode, or place icons directly on the knob if space permits.
